Problem-2

This assignment will test your knowledge on Hive advance concepts like Partitioning and more.

Input file u.user has users data who are rating movies in a movies database. This data is '|' delimited and each row has five fields. 
Fields have following values on each row in order : userid, age(in years), gender(M/F), occupation, zipcode.

ex: 902|45|F|artist|97203.

Tasks to perform on this data:

1. In Hive, Create a database and in this DB create an internal (managed) table to load this data. 

ls Downloads/Chandan
sed -n 1,5p Downloads/Chandan/u.user

hadoop fs -ls /
hadoop fs -mkdir /asgn

Hive

create database Asgn;
use Asgn;

osgdev@HadoopMI-40:~$

hive>

create table MovieData (
userid int,
age int, 
gender string, 
occupation string, 
zipcode string)
row format delimited fields terminated by '|' ;

load data local inpath '/Downloads/Chandan/u.user' into table moviedata

select * from moviedata limit 10;

2. Load this data from local filesystem (not from HDFS) to internal (managed) table created above.

load data local inpath ' C:\Users\chand\Desktop\hadoop\WiproHive\u.data' into table MovieData;

load data local inpath 'gs://cksproject/hiveAsgn/u.data' into table MovieData;


3. Create a partitioned table with partition on gender column (i.e. M and F partitions) and load data into this table from table loaded on task 2.

create table MovieData_Part (
userid int,
age int,  
occupation string, 
zipcode string) PARTITIONED BY ( gender string) 
row format delimited fields terminated by '|' ;

insert overwrite table MovieData_Part partition( gender )  select * from MovieData ;

4. List the HDFS filesystem and list the HDFS file created for above partitioned table.
5. Run query to get the below on non-partitioned internal table and partitioned internal table created above... 
   Avg age of female audience?
Avg age of male audience?
   Can you calculate note the time taken for each and calculate improved performance in case of partitioned tables.
