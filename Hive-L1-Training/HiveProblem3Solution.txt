Problem-3

This assignment will test your knowledge on Hive advance concept like Bucketing, Sampling etc.

Source file u.data has movie rating data in tab delimited format with columns: 

user id | item id | rating | timestamp(time stamps are unix seconds since 1/1/1970 UTC).

Perform the following task on this data:
1. Load source data from native OS filesystem in Hive tables: Non Bucketing
2. Load this data from Hive table to bucketed hive table with 3 buckets on userid column.
3. Count the records loaded in each bucket. List the Hadoop files created for this table.
   Do you see the difference from partitioned table?
4. Fetch average rating over 5% on sample data on bucketted rating table.
5. Fetch average rating on 3rd bucket of bucketted rating table.

Fetch average rating on full rating bucketted table and compare results.
